# Pea Plant Disease Prediction
This project focuses on predicting diseases in pea plants using a deep learning model. The dataset includes images of pea plant leaves categorized into four classes: Downy Mildew Leaf, Fresh Leaf, Leafminer Leaf, and Powder Mildew Leaf.

**Key Features:**
- **Data Collection:** Downloads and unzips the dataset from Kaggle.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Resizes and normalizes images, and applies data augmentation techniques.
- **Model Architecture:** Uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with multiple layers to classify images.
- **Training and Evaluation:** Trains the model on the dataset and evaluates its performance.
